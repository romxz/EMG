/*
Sending Data to Processing via the Serial Port
This sketch provides a basic framework to send data from Arduino to Processing over a Serial Port. This is a beginning level sketch.

Hardware:
* Sensors connected to Arduino input pins
* Arduino connected to computer via USB cord

Software:
*Arduino programmer
*Processing (download the Processing software here: https://www.processing.org/download/

Additional Libraries:
*Read about the Software Serial library here: http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/softwareSerial

/*To avoid overloading the Arduino memory, and to encourage portability to smaller microprocessors, this sketch
does not timestamp or transform data. In this tutorial, timestamping data is handled on the processing side.

Whether you process data on the Arduino side is up to you. Given memory limitations of the Arduino, even a few computations and mapping of values can
max out the memory and fail. I recommend doing as little as possible on the Arduino board.*/

/*Declare your sensor pins as variables. I'm using Analog In pins 0 and 1. Change the names and numbers as needed
Pro tip: If you're pressed for memory, use #define to declare your sensor pins without using any memory. Just be careful that your pin name shows up NOWHERE ELSE in your sketch!
for more info, see: http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Define

/*Create an array to store sensor values. I'm using floats. Floats use 4 bytes to represent numbers in exponential notation. Use int if you are representing whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767.
For more info on the appropriate data type for your sensor values, check out the language reference on data type: http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage
Customize the array's size to be equal to your number of sensors.

/*Pro tip: if you have a larger number of sensors, you can use a for loop to initialize your sensor value array. Here's sample code (assuming you have 6 sensor values):

int i;
for (i=0; i&lt;6; i++)
{
sensorVals[i] = 0;
